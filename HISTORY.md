## 0.0.1 (2023-07-07)
This is the first version. It provides the **VimeoConnection**, **VimeoData**, **Video** and **VimeoShowcase** and **VimeoFolder** classes.

The package is still very much in beta, as many of the possible methods of this classes are not implemented yet and other classes (e.g. for Groups or Portfolios) shall be implemented later. It is also not well tested at the moment. Use it at your own risk!
